Sidekick AI is a modular and intelligent interview assistant built using the OpenAI Agents SDK. This project simulates real-time interview experiences by dynamically generating questions based on user-selected topics, evaluating answers with contextual understanding, and providing structured feedback and performance summaries at the end.

This tool leverages autonomous agent collaboration to mirror the structure of real-world interviews — with separate agents responsible for topic identification, question generation (including web-searching capability), and final evaluation.

🚀 Features
Multi-agent architecture: Uses OpenAI’s Agents SDK to orchestrate collaboration between purpose-specific agents.

Web-aware questioning: Integrates a web search tool for real-time context fetching.

Answer evaluation: Grades responses based on relevance, depth, and correctness.

Feedback delivery: Provides clear, structured feedback at the end of each session.

Fully autonomous flow: From greeting to final feedback, the system runs end-to-end without manual intervention.

🎯 Use Cases
🧠 Mock Interviews: Practice technical or domain-specific interviews with instant feedback.

📚 Learning Assistant: Learn and reinforce concepts through targeted Q&A.

🎓 Skill Assessments: Evaluate yourself or others on specific topics or job roles.

🧪 AI Research: Explore multi-agent orchestration in real-world task flows.

🛠️ Tool Demonstration: Serve as a live demo for OpenAI Agents SDK in action.

📌 Example Flow
User selects areas of expertise (e.g., "Python", "Networking").

Agent 1 processes the expertise and passes context to the questioning agent.

Agent 2 asks relevant questions (may use web search if needed).

User answers via UI (Gradio).

Agent 3 evaluates the full session and provides a breakdown of performance, strengths, and areas of improvement.
